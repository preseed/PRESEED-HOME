                                        Blast from the recent past  from 2012 —  First, Nishchal started this community,

                                        empower entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs personally through mentoring
                                        them over my lectures in top colleges and through personal phone calls. Then,
                                        with the lessons of running that community for 2 years Nishchal started to build

                                        right cofounders/volunteers for their idea to bring it to reality. Idealistr was
                                        also meant to lay the foundation for attracting angel investors. This was a
                                        product for philosophers, engineers, doers, remote coworkers, entrepreneurs and
                                        aspiring entrepreneurs.

                                        Also, Nishchal had been dreaming since 2009 to channel the creations of
                                        technology students across the country towards solving real-world problems. So
                                        there is a wholesome growth in our society of students and solution seekers,
                                        which is the society as a whole. This can be achieved in a more social and
                                        democratic ways than that can be seen so far for there is a vision for a very
                                        noble cause but that vision needs to be translated into a vision for a web
                                        product and not a mere website. Thus making it more scalable. And this is true
                                        for us too.

                        2012,
                        Nishchal noticed that actionable/tasks exchanged during FB/Whatsapp chats on mobile had a
                        tendency to fade
                        away and be forgotten. This problem of not having tasks be easily assigned and accountable from
                        chats itself drove him to startup upon the idea of <b>Chattodo</b>. We know how hard it is to
                        manage
                        the work related chats in a growing startup in this noisy world of communication overload.
                        Chattodo
                        is built by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs to serve this exact purpose. This step is made up of
                        5
                        years of relentless research which most people won’t dare do. Check its steps in brief here.

                                        A remote team of 10 people uses on average 10 apps daily for research,
                                        communication and task management.e.g. Slack, Trello, Evernote, Googel docs,
                                        google caledar, emails, Wunderlist, Whasapp etc. According to our observation,
                                        each person of that team loses 30 minutes per day in switching from one app to
                                        another, and another 30 mins in tracking todos mentioned in chats i.e. 1 hour
                                        per day switching from one app to another which represents 10 hours per team per

                                        Visualize how your workforce is communicating and understand the specific
                                        patterns and trends that affect operations with internal communication
                                        analytics. The Network Map delivers a complete visual of how different groups
                                        and teams interact within the organization. This data allows you to identify
                                        disconnected workers, map performance against communication habits, and
                                        understand the organizational structure based on actual communication patterns.

                                        Group reports show the level of user activity broken down by each type of group
                                        (Official, Ad Hoc, and unnamed Ad Hoc groups). This allows you to see which
                                        topics are most pressing among field teams and which teams or regions
                                        communicate the most or least, which can then be correlated to performance.
                                        Tracking the creation of Ad Hoc groups is especially useful in proactively
                                        solving front-line issues that haven’t made their way to corporate or management
                                        teams.

                                        best practices. Oftentimes, the most active communicators are also the highest
                                        performers.

                                            Our demo showcases an absolutely new take on note making within a

                                            chat app. How is the note making experience of our chat app different from

                                                    brings on the productivity screen. (Even the tabs tray at the bottom
                                                    can lead to
                                                    various such screens on the App). In the launch ready App the first
                                                    screen is
                                                    always the note making screen, unless some notification on our app
                                                    is clicked.
                                                    Why? Because we want to give the user the experience of always
                                                    opening an
                                                    unobtrusive white blank screen. The key purpose of our app is
                                                    established when
                                                    people write, and what can be better than writing on an off white
                                                    blank screen,
                                                    even when writing a message.

                                                    Suppose the user continues writing notes, you will notice that he
                                                    returns to the

                                                        the two notes
                                                        is a new take on how we want our note app interface to differ

                                                    KP again
                                                    comes back
                                                    to the note making screen from the collection screen which
                                                    automatically gets
                                                    collections in it whenever there is a hashtag added to any text on
                                                    our app. So,
                                                    the line that separates two notes does away with the need of having
                                                    to open a
                                                    new note screen to type a new note. You can just type your note on
                                                    this one note
                                                    making screen, separating one note from the other by a dividing
                                                    line. Scroll up
                                                    and down to go from one note to the other. When you move a note to a
                                                    collection
                                                    it can be removed from the note making screen. So how long the
                                                    scroll is depends
                                                    entirely on you.

                                                    progresses
                                                    beyond 2:48, as mentioned in (1b) above? Essentially and uniquely, a
                                                    lot of
                                                    communication can be triggered in our App with just a blank note
                                                    making screen.
                                                    This is a simple, yet an extraordinary design leap. It makes the act
                                                    of typing
                                                    for note making and typing for sending a message to a collaborator
                                                    happen on the
                                                    same white blank screen. A white blank screen is a beautiful,
                                                    functional and
                                                    unobtrusive screen to type in. Basically, the thought comes to the
                                                    mind first,
                                                    then follows the step of who does it need to be sent to. We want to
                                                    follow this
                                                    natural flow in our Chat App as well. So one could instantly type it
                                                    out as a
                                                    note and put a @name to send it as a message. All of this without

                                                    user list as the first step common to all chat apps.

                                                    currently not so well placed in other popular note apps. Once we
                                                    place it on our
                                                    note making app, stand alone voice memo apps might become redundant.

                                            notice the mic placed
                                            in front of every
                                            user name, where the list of users shows up. Refer to your whatsapp user
                                            list.
                                            Now imagine such a mic there. The use of a mic for communication, over and
                                            above
                                            making a call is highly underrated. As a user, I use voice recordings much
                                            more
                                            than typing. It is quicker than calling or typing especially when you want
                                            to
                                            send a message and not just communicate instantly to and fro. We have
                                            consciously put the mic on users name list itself, so without having to open
                                            the
                                            chat screen of the user of choice from the list of users, one could send a

                                            on
                                            their
                                            chat screens as well. KP2 on the right side screen then mentions to KP that

                                            got KP’s message. KP then decides to send a message to KP2 which also
                                            happens to
                                            be a task that KP needs to accomplish so he marks it as a todo. The
                                            colourless
                                            dot turns Pink. What is visible to KP as a pink dot is visible to KP2 as
                                            blue.
                                            Notice how when the todo is assigned by KP to KP2 it turns his messages
                                            blank
                                            dot to blue. How did KP assign the message “Now I shall assign one to you”
                                            as a
                                            task to KP2? Watch 3:48 to 3:52 - By long pressing on its blank dot, and
                                            then
                                            clicking on the collaborator’s icon on the circle that opened up with 4
                                            icons.
                                            For KP2 that dot is Pink this time. This implies that a todo of one’s own
                                            self
                                            is pink and of the person being chatted with is blue. For a startup of 2
                                            people
                                            team, which is how things normally start, this clearly indicates that just a
                                            scroll on the chat screen will be enough for both users to know what in the
                                            whole chat is tasks and which task belongs to who. This will be true for any
                                            two
                                            people chatting on Chattodo. Now notice that KP marks a task done, merely by
                                            touching the pink dot. This implies, that a task can be marked done on the
                                            chat
                                            itself if it was first converted from a mere message to a a task.

                                    messages of the tags in it. The relevance of clicking the profile picture to open
                                    these tags is our take on how we can give insights into the<strong> personality of
                                        the user</strong>
                                    just by revealing what this user is collecting. A collection of topics that a user
                                    is interested in is a good way to reveal not only what he is collecting to learn
                                    from it, but also his personality.

                                    0.01.58 - 0.02.06 : The tags followed by the user show up in the feed section below
                                    the profile picture on the chat screen with the message and the tag name.
                                    <strong>This is
                                        really what we mean by a social network of action.</strong> Such are feeds of
                                    two people in
                                    an environment of action in Chattodo. This interface of feeds showing up on the chat
                                    screen shared between two unique users for collections they follow of each other is
                                    our take on how feeds should surface between people who collaborate with each other
                                    to do things, rather than people who just chat to talk, in which case they won’t
                                    mind mindlessly scrolling through everyone’s feed like in case of Facebook.

                                    0.02.07 - 0.02.28 : If one of the users unfollows the tag of the other user then it
                                    gets removed from the personal feed as well as the personal collections of the user
                                    who previously followed such a tag/collection.

                                    0.02.35 - 0.02.49 : When one of the user follows a tag which has a common tag name
                                    in both user collection then we see the feed gets updated to the new followed tag if
                                    the feed was created out of a post by the user whose tag was followed, obviously.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    0.02:50 - 0.03:32 : When the user whose tag has been followed adds a new message to
                                    the tag in his local collection then this gets reflected in the feed of the user who
                                    follows the tag.

                                    0.03.35 - 0.03.51 : Also a separate tag is created in the collection of the user who
                                    followed the tag even though it has the same tag name as the tag created locally.
                                    The tag created locally has messages of the user, while the tag followed has
                                    messages from the tag of the followed user.

                                for us to have them do their other works parallely. As they progressed
                                they had the choice of working only with us, to be stakeholders at
                                Preseed. </p>
                            <p class="boxtext3">Sooner or later this product and the team would be
                                incubated at an appropriate incubator. Until now, it was a MVP journey

                                our volunteer hackers/hustlers/designers, to make it all live for
                                testing/use with the early adopters and our networks. The churn with

                        <p class="buttonscontent">This is what was going on -</p>
                        <p class="buttonscontent">The origin of my thought for building Preseed was the
                            mission — To empower those with a will to do something extraordinary.
                            Further inquiring into this mission, I realised it meant having more
                            enterprising human resource for the world. Creating better human resources
                            implied identifying and fixing the core problem, which was the regressive
                            education system globally. So, on this mission we have vowed to build
                            products that help entrepreneurs. It is this collective mission and our
                            team’s togetherness that keeps us inspired.</p>
                        <p class="buttonscontent">Initially, I couldn’t imagine wholly how a product
                            could solve this problem. But since the goal of starting Preseed was to
                            solve this problem with a product, I called into my spine, the solution.

                            system, step I for me was— a Culture of Collaboration upon ideas at least in

                            Since little to no money is infused in the making of
                            Preseed until 2020, it has remained bootstrapped to not even have ever set
                            up a formal office space. Our offices are the homes/offices/coworking
                            spaces/cafes where our collaborators sit,
                            think and do. We have been a work from home culture from 10 years before
                            Covid. In fact we are bootstrapped to the extent that our core
                            team gets built not out of monthly compensations but out of inspiration to
                            chase a common ALTRUISTIC goal with us. Staying bootstrapped means to stay
                            simple and to not be in a hurry. Which in turn implies - look for hacks in
                            codes, in designs, in marketing,
                            in hiring and overall business building. <b>That, in turn, keeps our
                                operational costs to an unbelievable low.</b> This we think is a very
                            important attribute of Preseed as a business organization made up of
                            extraordinary hustle.

                                    Basically we have begun to understand the importance of bootstrapping for ones
                                    growth as a leader. For, we have found ourselves to grow leaps and bounds since
                                    Preseed started in a moment of no penny even to pay phone bills. It led Nishchal to
                                    become simpler. We are pretty sure those lessons are leading his team to a path of
                                    simplicity, where a failure of business doesn't mean the failure of a human.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h4>We once asked Nishchal, "what does simplicity lead to"?</h4>

                                    I will explain that with an example of a moment of thought while trying to go into a
                                    state of meditation. When you close your eyes and imagine, you imagine with greater
                                    clarity, sometimes enough clarity to experience what you are imagining near
                                    visually. So basically all the visual noise of the outside vanishes when you shut
                                    your eyes. Now you are only imagining. There is no outside noise. So when you start
                                    becoming simpler and start shedding off the extra, this is what happens. The
                                    backdrop in which you imagine becomes clean and boundless. <b>Simplicity leads to
                                        boundlessness</b>.

                                            time. We keep it to what's needed and where it's needed. Nothing that is not

                                        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Design is more important than engineering in the
                                            consumer web space. One of the problems we see in this space in India is not
                                            of that of engineering. In fact India produces strong engineers. It's a
                                            problem of design, for India seriously lacks consumer web 'design'
                                            sensibilities. The reason stands - lack of geeks here marrying some
                                            seriously cool people. We hope that someday we are able to teach that to

                            oceans & mountains, roll in green meadows, make love, my own furniture, watch the stars and
                            satellites. Just like any of you. My alter ego even then, however, at all times, wanted to
                            just build a great company 24*7 that takes human culture, to freedom. In my attempt to
                            gratify my own senses, I may leave nothing for our children to cherish, but their own
                            intoxication & depression; unless I use my knowledge to see, in everyone, especially those
                            who suffer, my own children. For, I cannot unsee, what I have seen. I believe that in a
                            contemporary society product leadership may be enough. A mic and/or protests are not

                            है। एजुकेशन सिस्टम का अन्याय यह है कि उसने हर बच्चे को किताब के साथ चार दिवारी में बंद कर
                            दिया है। अब ना बच्चों के पास खुला वातावरण है और न ही फुर्सत, न ही गुरु है जिनसे प्रेरणा

                                    I have been chasing a dream to create an alternative education system. To be that, I
                                    have to be the greatest todo listing tool first, by 2023.

                                    Let this be the first and the last time I speak about the word ‘education’ in
                                    context to Chattodo. Let it all happen organically when it happens. It is that goal
                                    that pulled me in this direction of giving the world a new social network with all I
                                    got. That is all I want to say for the realm of education for now. The below is a
                                    greater one time dive into that.

                    By the time we reach phase 2 we see the trend of students working as teams chasing an idea for a
                    startup will be on the rise, and that is when we should be ready to give students educational
                    qualification by our AI on the basis of the tasks these students are accomplishing. This is a matter
                    of 5 more years of digital consumer centric innovation in education even for the pioneer. We have a
                    strong chance to be those pioneers.</p>

                    <strong> Team build — The way the team is represented by/in a company should get democratized
                        now</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    While building Preseed I encountered a problem of listing in and listing out of my team members.
                    More so, as we are an organisation that runs a very liberal culture of hiring and firing. Here
                    people come at will and leave at will and we don’t batt an eyelid. We sort of really enjoy going
                    with the flow of both entry and exit. To make this transition of an employee entry into my company
                    and exit from my company smooth and botheration free, I want to give the control of all an employees
                    representation to the employee himself. <br> <br>
                    In essence what I am saying is that the team admin only need to approve to add an employee into the
                    team, where the employee himself writes his own job description, adds his own social icons, uploads
                    his id docs, gets access to all related HR documents, understand his roles, performance indicators,
                    compensations, rewards, get connected to the team and start getting introduced to whoever he needs
                    to work with within the team. This will be a place for all employee matters of a company. This
                    feature is a big feature of our product. <br> <br>
                    So this will extend in the future to be a dashboard for the HR department(which with the help of
                    this tool will only become thinner) and the employees of a company, for large companies. <br> <br>
                    But for now, we will just do it’s MVP and look to build some traction for it, as indicated on it’s
                    current web page. <br> <br>

                        all over the web, just in case they wanted to explore those topics more. E.g. if these two users

                    I hate the way people have to exchange their contact co ordinates day to day with different people.
                    <br> <br>
                    If I exchange a number, an email or a twitter handle with a person, or a unique Pin Code he should
                    get an access to all my public identity systems; but that doesn’t happen yet. Instead there are
                    longer and uglier ways of finding people on our phone contact books and even more complicated ways
                    of finding them on social web.
                    Worst is that if I have to save someone’s number or twitter handle or email, I have to add their
                    name first and then type out their related URL. Then one day I may need their facebook, quora or
                    soundcloud id, then, I will have to reach them again to get it. Worse, even though at my end I have
                    recorded their details, meaning I have put in that effort into recording details on my contact app
                    for this person, yet this person will have to repeat the process of writing my name in his contact
                    book, my phone number, my email etc. IT IS ALL TOO AGE OLD.
                    <strong> Add to contactcards through a pin, number, email or twitter, or any other product listed

                    the eye of the user at any given time. <br>
                    We mean it, it is the simplest and more scalable solution to what bump and evernote hello attempted
                    to do. <br>
                    -Embedded into the default contact apps of ones phones. <br><br>
                    <strong> Goal</strong> <br><br>
                    To one day have this product be a ‘protocol’ for identity of millions of people on this new age
                    social web. <br><br>
                    <i>We will together hustle enough to make this a reality.</i> <br><br>
                    </strong> A passing thought</strong> <br><br>
                    The way I envision this product it could be a great chat app of sorts too. Anyway let this not
                    distract the key and only purpose of this product i.e. to be a contact app for the new age, the
                    mobile web age.

                    <strong>Question: What
                        differentiates our product in the market? What is our competitive advantage? Or will be moving
                        forward?</strong> <br><br>
                    <strong> Answer: </strong>The clear strength of this product is in it’s simplicity and novelty, hard
                    to find now a
                    days, in productivity tools. Most of them are rip offs of each other just designed differently. We
                    are fundamentally different and that makes it very worthy of attention for acquisition from extra
                    ordinary companies. Most of the competitive todo listing apps work on input basis, as in you have to
                    physically type the todo up then submit it to save a task. It breaks the flow of communication. In
                    our case, the flow of discussion is not broken and yet one is able to record that task at that very
                    instance.

                        Chat apps including Slack, assumes that communication between 2 participants or more can keep
                        moving forward as is, unless ofcourse the user wants to drown himself or herself in the sea of
                        features and integrations on Slack; and for those words that look like clear tasks, the
                        participants will either remember those, or participants will make notes of those where ever
                        they want, by retyping those. Worse still, they assume, it is okay to make them scroll up to
                        find what all is their task. <strong> Is that the result of the empathy they have for teams
                            communicating? </strong>Unless and until the experience is not exactly like how I am
                        suggesting through
                        the image below, Slack is not aiding its simplest users best. What about Whatsapp? Let's not
                        even start there.

                    <br>
                <h6> Slack is the right latter stage investor for Todoed.</h6>
                I once even thought of writing to Mr. Butterfield, <br> <br>
                I am building a product that can eat into your market share over the course of the next 5 years. I
                assure you. To what portion? The same portion as of the market share proportionate to that portion of
                overall communication on Slack, which is one on one communication. However, the good news is, we are
                making this product hoping that you will keep a big piece of it. (We think if we ever were to be
                acquired, the acquirer would be you, Slack would acquire us. Unless we beat you at what you are doing.
                Although that is not the aim, if anything, the aim is to aid you :). <br> <br>
                I don’t know what is the size of it. I just know I am one such user from that exact market portion, that
                portion, in which chat exchange is attributed to one on one communication. I communicate a lot like
                that. I assume there must be a lot of users of Slack communicating like that. You must know the numbers.
                Since, you are Slack. The product used by everyone from my target market. However, my target market is
                not only limited to the users of Slack. Because users of Slack are the mature productive audience. My
                product will help onboard them, when they are not so mature. <br> <br>
                That is exactly why I write to you. I have a crisp vision. I will take 3 years to execute it without
                you. I will take less than 1 year to execute it with you as the sole investor(because I don’t want
                anyone other than you). I have laid a part of that vision already. I can demo it to you. It’s right here
                <a href="https://www.chattodo.co/"> — www.chattodo.co</a> <br> <br>
                Chattodo is to Slack, what Twitter is to Facebook. Fundamentally different.
                Touch a message, and that message could be moved to a todo list for which currently other apps are
                integrated with Slack, whether with Zapier, or directly. <br> <br>
                Btw, here is why this chat product that I am proposing is necessary - <br> <br>
                1. Slack is a winner. Period. It is a winner of the world of group communication for productive people.
                Very meaningful for companies. Currently even startups of 3 humans are using Slack. For lack of better
                options of products that just facilitate their communication among these 3. No need for having so many
                buttons and options when there are just 3 people to talk to. To such men and women, our product will be
                more meaningful, not only because it does this least very crisply, it also makes your conversations more
                actionable, because it does the least, it has room for doing something new to the chat experience of
                those who in swift moments of thoughts want to communicate one on one, while being actionable and
                accountable. Our chat app, can induce these 3 to be more accountable for tasks that were discussed in
                such chats. <br> <br>
                2. Slack assumes that we, productive people with a team, just want to communicate with, each other, in
                groups — There are 3 problems here A). Each other — No, we communicate with our self too. Our product,
                is a todo listing / note making tool. This is how a conversation with self happens. B). In groups — No,
                sometimes all we want is to communicate with one person out of the 10 I communicate with for work. I
                don’t need no group/channel chat interfacing in such moments. C). Before I communicate with others,
                there are times when I communicate with my self — and then I, address that thought which I just typed on
                the text edit box of Todoed to the person I want to communicate to. Pay attention to this point please.
                It is deep. To do this currently I have to open the chat box for that person, and then re produce that
                thought, to type to his chat box. With the Chat product I am proposing there is tremendous empathy for
                this effort of opening the chat box for such a thought. In our chat app, you put your thought first, and
                address it right there to the concerned person. You don’t address the person first before putting in the
                thought. If you have to open the chat screen of that person or any chat screen, then you are adressing
                the person first, even before actually baking the thought you have. No opening of his chat box hence,
                just one text edit box is enough. So these fellows can further such delegated tasks as a chats as well,
                in the chat screen, and this message that you sent, will show up as a todo item right there too as well
                as in his chat window with you. And wonderfully, exactly in the same space where you sent a message to
                your co worker, which btw, magically shows up in his todo list, you could send a message to yourself,
                your thought, to yourself, which also magically shows up in your todo list.
                <br><br>
                <strong> Did I say todo list? </strong> <br> <br>
                Above, I indicated, that since this chat app will do the least, (imagine facebook for 10 people kind of
                chatting, just stripped down of casual features and emoticons), hence, it has room for doing more.
                <strong> Something fundamentally new, not only helping in facilitating communication but also with one
                    tap,
                    absolutely one tap, make that communication, actionable.</strong>
                This is why this chat app, designed for instant one on one styled conversations* only, will make people
                more productive, then any other chat product in the world.
                Because it has a way of making your chats more productive even more seamlessly than you could do it with
                Slack integrated with Wunderlist. <br> <br>
                Chattodo is what will make this possible - <br> <br>
                Chattodo chatting will move that chat message to a todo list, with just one single tap — on that chat
                message. <br> <br>
                This act of making things typed, reach a todo list, that seamlessly, is exactly why we are making this
                chat app. <br> <br>
                Lets see how it goes. <br> <br>
                However, if Slack is not interested in Todoed, then our next company to go to will be Yammer. Todoed can
                be a tool that can revive Yammer or Upwork. <br> <br>
                Not only that, Chattodo is a product that can kill Evernote, for being a much better tool for
                note-making. To say the least. It will go all the way to being more useful for one on one productivity
                communication/chat. The space google to Facebook, all are eyeing to nail. <br> <br>
                I do see the possibility for Chattodo to emerge as an eventual winner in the productivity market
                inclusive of notes, todo listing, and chats. I am convinced we may have a better vision than the
                biggies, we may not have the technology for the AI part, just yet. They will be better at that. But only
                till we get to that. We are not willing to underestimate ourselves.
