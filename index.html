                                        Blast from the recent past  from 2012 —  First, Nishchal started this community,
                                        Preseed, as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thepreseed">FB page</a> to
                                        empower entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs personally through mentoring
                                        them over my lectures in top colleges and through personal phone calls. Then,
                                        with the lessons of running that community for 2 years Nishchal started to build
                                        a web product called Idealistr in 2014 (find it in step 3 of <a
                                            href="https://preseeded.preseed.in/">
                                            preseeded.preseed.in</a>) to empower potential entrepreneurs, across the
                                        world, by
                                        suitably profiling them and making them discoverable. The main problem faced by
                                        aspiring entrepreneurs who want to turn an idea into reality is getting good
                                        talent. Idealistr aimed to solve that problem by helping change makers find the
                                        right cofounders/volunteers for their idea to bring it to reality. Idealistr was
                                        also meant to lay the foundation for attracting angel investors. This was a
                                        product for philosophers, engineers, doers, remote coworkers, entrepreneurs and
                                        aspiring entrepreneurs.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Also, Nishchal had been dreaming since 2009 to channel the creations of
                                        technology students across the country towards solving real-world problems. So
                                        there is a wholesome growth in our society of students and solution seekers,
                                        which is the society as a whole. This can be achieved in a more social and
                                        democratic ways than that can be seen so far for there is a vision for a very
                                        noble cause but that vision needs to be translated into a vision for a web
                                        product and not a mere website. Thus making it more scalable. And this is true
                                        for us too.

                                    Idealistr was designed to facilitate a transition of a problem into a

                    <p class="journycontent2">In the early days of Preseed during remote communication with his team in
                        2012,
                        Nishchal noticed that actionable/tasks exchanged during FB/Whatsapp chats on mobile had a
                        tendency to fade
                        away and be forgotten. This problem of not having tasks be easily assigned and accountable from
                        chats itself drove him to startup upon the idea of <b>Chattodo</b>. We know how hard it is to
                        manage
                        the work related chats in a growing startup in this noisy world of communication overload.
                        Chattodo
                        is built by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs to serve this exact purpose. This step is made up of
                        5
                        years of relentless research which most people won’t dare do. Check its steps in brief here.

                                ideas years in advance (to run it for a small group) to test its
                                viability before I could vouch for it, so it could be re-built with
                                greater insight; while scrapping the prototype for it has served its
                                purpose of validation for me. Scrapping it, for it becomes difficult to
                                maintain the prototype, especially if you are a founder who made the
                                prototype by inspiring a bunch of volunteers with your designs and
                                vision. Volunteers knew how to code, and you yourself don’t know how to
                                code,but they often leave prematurely. The best solution is, take the
                                result of validation to a stronger team to build the MVP from scratch.
                                That was the journey it took from the prototype of Todoed to the current

                            <p class="boxtext2"> 7 years ago, volunteers were all we needed. This is
                                what we expected from our volunteers:</p>
                            <p class="boxtext3">We like to take it easy. It is not a grind. Above all,
                                it's a vision for which there is time.</p>
                            <p>We expected a MVP that works. Having said that, as long as they could
                                deliver the MVP on our ‘product vision’ and design, it is perfectly okay
                                for us to have them do their other works parallely. As they progressed
                                they had the choice of working only with us, to be stakeholders at
                                Preseed. </p>

                                around my desire to collaborate with the hackers and designers, to build
                                useful consumer web product MVPs at little to no monetary costs. So that the
                                need of money was not to be the concern while I live the life I desired. The
                                life of whims. But someone who especially understands that nothing is of
                                consequence in my life till Chattodo is in the hands of millions of users.

                                Chattodo” - Nishchal:</b></p>
                        <p class="buttonscontent">This is what was going on -</p>
                        <p class="buttonscontent">The origin of my thought for building Preseed was the
                            mission — To empower those with a will to do something extraordinary.
                            Further inquiring into this mission, I realised it meant having more
                            enterprising human resource for the world. Creating better human resources
                            implied identifying and fixing the core problem, which was the regressive
                            education system globally. So, on this mission we have vowed to build
                            products that help entrepreneurs. It is this collective mission and our
                            team’s togetherness that keeps us inspired.</p>
                        <p class="buttonscontent">Initially, I couldn’t imagine wholly how a product
                            could solve this problem. But since the goal of starting Preseed was to
                            solve this problem with a product, I called into my spine, the solution.
                        </p>
                        <p class="buttonscontent">2012— In order to solve this problem of the education
                            system, step I for me was— a Culture of Collaboration upon ideas at least in
                            my space of being, Delhi- NCR, Inda. I opened myself and my ideas to the
                            youth around through my Facebook page, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thepreseed"
                                target=_blank>Preseed</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="buttonscontent">2013— Got invited to deliver talks among the top
                            graduate colleges around me about entrepreneurship and matters of
                            entrepreneurship. Through these talks I had built an environment that was to
                            aid me in conceiving the above mentioned products. Check out this massive
                            effort through the gallery section of <a href="http://ecell.preseed.in"

                        <p class="buttonscontent">2014— Initiated Preseed as a company in 2014 — It
                            started with its incorporation as Preseed Ventures Pvt. Ltd. Around this
                            time, I wrote much around the philosophy of our culture — for humans of
                            ideas around this time, a lot of which you see on our websites and blogs
                            today. </p>
                        <p class="buttonscontent">2015— Wireframes — I designed this solution’s
                            wireframes for mobile phones, for it to reach a larger bandwidth on 100s of
                            A4 sheets. We call that product, Chattodo. It's ready for Android. </p>

                        <p class="buttonscontent">2017— I was convinced that my products will make
                            communication on ideas more actionable first, and will have the potential to
                            disrupt the secondary education system right from there. Prototypes was
                            built for both the products with which I will challenge the status quo of

                        <p class="buttonscontent">So fundamentally, like I said,<b> making text more

                            students of the future, as much as it is the way forward for any

                            getting educated. It is a continuous process. </p>

                            Since little to no money is infused in the making of
                            Preseed until 2020, it has remained bootstrapped to not even have ever set
                            up a formal office space. Our offices are the homes/offices/coworking
                            spaces/cafes where our collaborators sit,
                            think and do. We have been a work from home culture from 10 years before
                            Covid. In fact we are bootstrapped to the extent that our core
                            team gets built not out of monthly compensations but out of inspiration to
                            chase a common ALTRUISTIC goal with us. Staying bootstrapped means to stay
                            simple and to not be in a hurry. Which in turn implies - look for hacks in
                            codes, in designs, in marketing,
                            in hiring and overall business building. <b>That, in turn, keeps our

                                    bootstrapped allows us to push ourselves to look for hacks in codes, in designs, in
                                    marketing, in hiring and overall business building. That, in turn, keeps our

                                    Basically we have begun to understand the importance of bootstrapping for ones
                                    growth as a leader. For, we have found ourselves to grow leaps and bounds since
                                    Preseed started in a moment of no penny even to pay phone bills. It led Nishchal to
                                    become simpler. We are pretty sure those lessons are leading his team to a path of
                                    simplicity, where a failure of business doesn't mean the failure of a human.

                                    <h4>We once asked Nishchal, "what does simplicity lead to"?</h4>

                                    I will explain that with an example of a moment of thought while trying to go into a
                                    state of meditation. When you close your eyes and imagine, you imagine with greater
                                    clarity, sometimes enough clarity to experience what you are imagining near
                                    visually. So basically all the visual noise of the outside vanishes when you shut
                                    your eyes. Now you are only imagining. There is no outside noise. So when you start
                                    becoming simpler and start shedding off the extra, this is what happens. The
                                    backdrop in which you imagine becomes clean and boundless. <b>Simplicity leads to
                                        boundlessness</b>.

                                            consumer web space. One of the problems we see in this space in India is not
                                            of that of engineering. In fact India produces strong engineers. It's a
                                            problem of design, for India seriously lacks consumer web 'design'
                                            sensibilities. The reason stands - lack of geeks here marrying some
                                            seriously cool people. We hope that someday we are able to teach that to

                        <p class="buttonscontent">Nishchal said, " 7 years ago while I was in college, I just wanted to
                            live a simple life, be in love, party all night, drink, dance, smoke pot, play sports, tavel
                            oceans & mountains, roll in green meadows, make love, my own furniture, watch the stars and
                            satellites. Just like any of you. My alter ego even then, however, at all times, wanted to
                            just build a great company 24*7 that takes human culture, to freedom. In my attempt to
                            gratify my own senses, I may leave nothing for our children to cherish, but their own
                            intoxication & depression; unless I use my knowledge to see, in everyone, especially those
                            who suffer, my own children. For, I cannot unsee, what I have seen. I believe that in a
                            contemporary society product leadership may be enough. A mic and/or protests are not
                            necessary.
                            क्योंकि मैं यह मानता हूं कि आधुनिक जमाने के/की लीडर प्रोडक्ट्स से समाज में बदलाव ला सकते
                            हैं। मैंने अपने 7 साल उसी प्रकार की लीडर शिप के माध्यम से एजुकेशन सिस्टम में चल रहे अन्याय
                            को बदलने में लगा दिये है। आज उसका रिजल्ट यह है कि आप मेरी बनाई हुई चैटिंग एप और उसके संबंध
                            मे लिखे हुये निबंध को देख पाएंगे कि कैसे वार्तालाप और कर्मों के बीच भी ज्ञान दिया जा सकता
                            है। एजुकेशन सिस्टम का अन्याय यह है कि उसने हर बच्चे को किताब के साथ चार दिवारी में बंद कर
                            दिया है। अब ना बच्चों के पास खुला वातावरण है और न ही फुर्सत, न ही गुरु है जिनसे प्रेरणा
                            मिले| बच्चे अपनी आत्मा की कुर्बानी देकर ऐसे विद्यालय में दसियों साल समझौता कर रहे हैं मैं इस
                            देश में यह सब बदलना चाहता हूं| यह बदलने के लिए मुझे लोकतंत्र के नेताओं और वोटों की शक्ति
                            नहीं चाहिए, सिर्फ सॉफ्टवेयर <b>इंजीनियर, डिज़ाइनर और मैनेजर चाहिए।</b>

                    not, how do you pick one over the others? We came here through a general google search for
                    <b>Preseed funding</b> for our startup. We found your webpage called The Simple fund through this
                    link <a href="http://simple.preseed.in">simple.preseed.in</a> on the first page of that Google
                    search result. Is your company Preseed Ventures Pvt. Ltd also an incubator or an investor of some
                    kind?</p>

                <p class="faqcontent">A) Preseed is a virtual incubator* primarily focused on incubating Nishchal’s own
                    products first, which in turn are directly aligned with our mission of greater freedom. Preseed
                    takes
                    inspiration in the way Nishchal thinks business ideas. Hence, it stays focused on finding
                    resources to empower him on his products first. The vision for the fund above is also really to find
                    an investor who can create this fund which in turn enables us to continue finding more entrepreneurs
                    like Nishchal who really want to do something genuinely meaningful. And meaningful is that which
                    gives people greater freedom. </p>
                <p class="faqcontent">We have designed this website to look for people mostly to work on Nishchal’s own
                    consumer web ideas. That is why Nishchal built Preseed in the first place. However,
                    if there is ‘someone with an idea’ and or capability that catches his fancy, we would be willing to
                    put in all we can into that idea too.</p>

                    physical space, or monetary investment. For us to support people who are self-inspired, just an
                    internet connection at their homes is sufficient.</p>
                <p class="faqcontent"><span class="highlightedpink">TSF is a concept for now. We are however curating
                        deals to build a fund around. So
                        far the success we have achieved can be measured by how many startups have found TSF web page
                        organically by searching a relevant keyword called ‘Preseed funding’. We have engaged with over
                        20%
                        of such startups, meaning 20+ relevant startups ready to raise money. We are nearly ready to
                        float a
                        fund around our startup deal flow. If you are an investor, please get in touch with
