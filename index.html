                something out of the ordinary - by often encouraging them to drop out of their colleges or jobs to
                pursue their lofty ideas, if I felt I could raise their intensity to face what may be coming. Why? Long
                ago, I asked myself the question about what is the one thing I must do with my capabilities - the answer
                I got was - I must do everything I can, to <span class="boldcontent2">give our world, better leaders</span>. As I progressed I was
                able to marry in vision, my previous failed social networking startup of 2009 to become now, a more

			</p>
			<p class="journycontent2">In the early days of Preseed during remote communication with his team in 2012,
                    Nishchal noticed that actionable/tasks exchanged during FB/Whatsapp chats on mobile had a tendency to fade
                    away and be forgotten. This problem of not having tasks be easily assigned and accountable from
                    chats itself drove him to startup upon the idea of <b>Chattodo</b>. We know how hard it is to manage
                    the work related chats in a growing startup in this noisy world of communication overload. Chattodo
                    is built by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs to serve this exact purpose. This step is made up of 5
                    years of relentless research which most people won’t dare do. Check its steps in brief here. Read

                                                viability before I could vouch for it, so it could be re-built with
                                                greater insight; while scrapping the prototype for it has served its
                                                purpose of validation for me. Scrapping it, for it becomes difficult to
                                                maintain the prototype, especially if you are a founder who made the
                                                prototype by inspiring a bunch of volunteers with your designs and
                                                vision. Volunteers knew how to code, and you yourself don’t know how to
                                                code,but they often leave prematurely. The best solution is, take the
                                                result of validation to a stronger team to build the MVP from scratch.
                                                That was the journey it took from the prototype of Todoed to the current

                                                for us to have them do their other works parallely. As they progressed

                                            mission — To empower those with a will to do something extraordinary.
                                            Further inquiring into this mission, I realised it meant having more
                                            enterprising human resource for the world. Creating better human resources
                                            implied identifying and fixing the core problem, which was the regressive
                                            education system globally. So, on this mission we have vowed to build
                                            products that help entrepreneurs. It is this collective mission and our

                                            up a formal office space. Our offices are the homes/offices/coworking

                                            Preseed started in a moment of a failure of Nishchal’s previous business.
                                            With no penny even to pay phone bills, it led Nishchal to become simpler.

                                    <h4>Bootstrapping leads to simplicity.</h4>
                                Since little to no money is infused in the making of Preseed, it has remained bootstrapped to not even have set up an office space. Our offices are the homes/offices/coworking spaces/cafes where our collaborators sit, think and do. In fact we are bootstrapped to the extent that our core team gets built not out of monthly compensations but out of inspiration to chase a common goal with us. We have learned what it means to stay bootstrapped. It means to stay simple. It means to — not be in a hurry.
                                <br><br>
                                Our appetite to not only stay bootstrapped ourselves but also keep our startups bootstrapped allows us to push ourselves to look for hacks in codes, in designs, in marketing, in hiring and overall business building. That, in turn, keeps our operational costs to an unbelievable low. That we think is a very important attribute of Preseed as a business organization made up of extraordinary hustle.
                                <br><br>
                                Basically we have begun to understand the importance of bootstrapping for ones growth as a leader. For, we have found ourselves to grow leaps and bounds since Preseed started in a moment of no penny even to pay phone bills. It led Nishchal to become simpler. We are pretty sure those lessons are leading his team to a path of simplicity, where a failure of business doesn't mean the failure of a human.
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>We once asked Nishchal, "what does simplicity lead to"?</h4>

                                I will explain that with an example of a moment of thought while trying to go into a state of meditation. When you close your eyes and imagine, you imagine with greater clarity, sometimes enough clarity to experience what you are imagining near visually. So basically all the visual noise of the outside vanishes when you shut your eyes. Now you are only imagining. There is no outside noise. So when you start becoming simpler and start shedding off the extra, this is what happens. The backdrop in which you imagine becomes clean and boundless. <b>Simplicity leads to boundlessness</b>.

One of the problems we see in this space in India is not of that of engineering. In fact India produces strong engineers. It's a problem of design, for India seriously lacks consumer web 'design' sensibilities. The reason stands - lack of geeks here marrying some seriously cool people. We hope that someday we are able to teach that to India through our products.</p>

We iterate, customer validate and reiterate. If we fail, we also fail fast, we re-iterate even faster and all of that, at minimum cost implications. In short we make sure we customer validate the products before we look to move to the next steps of development.

                            oceans & mountains, roll in green meadows, make love, my own furniture, watch the stars and
                            satellites. Just like any of you. My alter ego even then, however, at all times, wanted to
                            just build a great company 24*7 that takes human culture, to freedom. In my attempt to
                            gratify my own senses, I may leave nothing for our children to cherish, but their own
                            intoxication & depression; unless I use my knowledge to see, in everyone, especially those
                            who suffer, my own children. For, I cannot unsee, what I have seen. I believe that in a
                            contemporary society product leadership may be enough. A mic and/or protests are not
                            necessary.

							है। एजुकेशन सिस्टम का अन्याय यह है कि उसने हर बच्चे को किताब के साथ चार दिवारी में बंद कर
							दिया है। अब ना बच्चों के पास खुला वातावरण है और न ही फुर्सत, न ही गुरु है जिनसे प्रेरणा
							मिले| बच्चे अपनी आत्मा की कुर्बानी देकर ऐसे विद्यालय में दसियों साल समझौता कर रहे हैं मैं इस

                                    for <b>education upon collaboration.</b> That is why step 1 was necessary.
                                    ‘Education upon collaboration’ is my solution for the much-needed change in the
                                    archaic education system through Chattodo, a communication and collaboration app.
                                    This is fundamentally different from how you have looked innovation in Education by
                                    the virtue of education policy changes in India or incremental innovations in the

                                    3 before we get started with the works of AI of Step 4, which will measure education
                                    by capturing communication and collaboration between two people chasing a common
                                    goal, with their permissions of course. Creating both <b>a world of education upon
                                        curiosity and education upon collaboration.</b></p>

                                        reason we embarked on the journey to build Chattodo is to disrupt the education
                                        system for people of ideas whose learning must be measured by the accomplishment

                        artificial intelligence, towards understanding user exchanges of years, for quantifying them as
                        education degrees  — we will consider the education system disrupted, while saving the world

                        wants the elected representatives to list their todos, and the public to monitor those todos,
                        and give feedback over chats with their representative’s offices. Promises spoken and results
                        delivered must be visually represented on Chattodo’s dashboard for each country.

                <p class="faqcontent">Q) ) Are you looking only for people to work on your specific ideas, Nishchal? If
                    not, how do you pick one over the others? We came here through a general google search for
                    <b>Preseed funding</b> for our startup. We found your webpage called The Simple fund through this
                    link <a href="http://simple.preseed.in">simple.preseed.in</a> on the first page of that Google
                    search result. Is your company Preseed Ventures Pvt. Ltd also an incubator or an investor of some
                    kind?</p>

                <p class="faqcontent">A) Preseed is a virtual incubator* primarily focused on incubating Nishchal’s own
                    products first, which in turn are directly aligned with our mission of Freedom. Preseed takes
                    inspiration in the way Nishchal think’s business ideas and hence, it stays focused on finding
                    resources to empower him on his products first. The vision for the fund above is also really to find
                    an investor who can create this fund which in turn enables us to continue finding more entrepreneurs
                    like Nishchal who really want to do something genuinely meaningful. And meaningful is that which
                    gives people greater freedom. </p>
                <p class="faqcontent">We have designed this website to look for people mostly to work on Nishchal’s own
                    consumer web ideas, that is right. That is why Nishchal built Preseed in the first place. However,
                    if there is ‘someone with an idea’ and or capability that catches his fancy, we would be willing to
                    put in all we can into that idea too.</p>
                <p class="faqcontent">His experiences puts him in a fairly good position to make judgments about
                    what/who to pursue and what/who to say no to.</p>
                <p class="faqcontent">*An incubator that supports you like any other incubator but without a fixed
                    physical space, or monetary investment. For us to support people who are self-inspired, just an
                    internet connection at their homes is sufficient.</p>
                <p class="faqcontent"><span class="highlightedpink">TSF is a concept for now. We are however curating deals to build a fund around. So
                    far the success we have achieved can be measured by how many startups have found TSF web page
                    organically by searching a relevant keyword called ‘Preseed funding’. We have engaged with over 20%
                    of such startups, meaning 20+ relevant startups ready to raise money. We are nearly ready to float a
                    fund around our startup deal flow. If you are an investor, please get in touch with
                    nishchal@preseed.in.</span></p>
